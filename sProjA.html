<div style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
	When I took ITP 485 (Programming Game Engines), the second part of the semester we made a class wide game using the Ogre game engine.
	<br>
	<br>
	We made AMAZEing in the Spring of 2011.
	<br>
	It's a single player, procedurally generated, labyrinth game. You must complete goals as you progress through the maze, save at check points, and fight labrynth monsters.
	I worked on the "Player sub-team" - I mostly handled collision between the Player (later extended to monsters) and the environment.
	<br>
