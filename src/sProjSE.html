<div style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
	I participated in the Fall 2011 Game Hackathon at USC. The Hachathon that I participated in was an week long Game-Jam.
	<br>
	Our goal was to make a game, in a week, using a given poem as inspiration.
	<br>
	The poem was can be found <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171951">here</a>.
	<br>
	My team (see below) and I decided to make a 2D platformer.
	<br>
	You use your shadow, through casting it onto different surfaces, to progress and kill enemies.
	<br>
	Though we did not have the game as finished as we'd have liked, it was still a lot of fun and I'm really happy with the style and design of the game.
	<br>
	My team consisted of:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Brandon Risberg
		</li>
		<li>
			Nick Covey
		</li>
		<li>
			Antonio Cade
		</li>
		<li>
			Jasper Lee
		</li>
		<li>
			Yin Chan
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Screenshots and video to come!
