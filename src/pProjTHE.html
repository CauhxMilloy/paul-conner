	Twilight Horizon Entertainment is a small indie video game development company that I started in 2009 with a few friends.
	Since we all have full time jobs, we work on this in our spare time. It's very much a labor of love sort of thing.
	<br>
	<br>
	We are working on our own proprietary cross-platform game engine in C++. We also write our own development tools; these are written in C#, as well as MEAN stack web apps.
	<br>
	<br>
	People who have currently work at Twilight Horizon are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Me (President, Lead Engineer, Lead Design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Antonio Cade (Artist)
