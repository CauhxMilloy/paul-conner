	Twilight Horizon Entertainment is a small indie video game development team that I started.
	I started it in 2009 with a few friends.
	We've been working on games in our spare time.
	Sadly, since we're all either full time students and/or have full time jobs, we havn't been able to release a game.
	This is very much a labor of love sort of thing. However, it has given me a lot of experience in game design.
	We have a strong focus in documentation and prototyping. Since time is in such sort supply, we make sure not to waste any time implementing something that we're unsure of.
	<br>
	<br>
	Working with Twilight Horizon has given me a lot of opportunities to write libraries for making games.
	I have extensive C# libraries (we've used XNA a lot for games we've worked on) and I've been able to re-use those libraries in school projects.
	These libraries cover a multitude of game engine necessities, including: Object Network Serialization, Graphics APIs, Platforming, HLSL Shaders and Job Thread Pools; there's a lot to be had.
	<br>
	<br>
	Along side those libraries, I've made quite a few developer tools.
	One of the tools I'm most proud of is the custom art/animation pipeline that I've made.
	My goal was for the artists that I work with to import art assets from any program they may use and be able to - through a few steps - import that as animated sprites (that automagically work in engine).
	This required making my own PSD parser (so they can load PSD files, and turn on/off layers on the fly in my dev tools).
	I fully realize that many tools out there aren't (for the lack of better descriptive words) "good".
	I'd like to use my programming knowledge to make sure the people I work with aren't frustrated with bad tools.
	Recently, I was working on porting some of my libraries to Objective-C, so my art pipeline would also work for iPhone development as well.
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm also working on my own game engine in C++.
	The scope of this engine will be large, to encompass any game we could think of making.
	I'd also like it to work on multiple platforms, and be well abstracted so all high-level game code would not (necessarily) be too tightly coupled with any platform.
	<br>
	<br>
	I try to wear many hats at Twilight Horizon - including: President, Game Designer, Lead Programmer, Playtest Organizer, and Project Manager.
	<br>
	People who have worked with me on games are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Marcos Rodriguez (Art and Game Design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Anna Fu (Webmaster, UI Design, and Game Design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Nick Covey (Game Design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Brandon Risberg (Programming and Game Design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Jinson Yu (UI Programmming and Game Design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Antonio Cade (Art and Game Design)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	As you can see, everyone does a bit of Game Design. We all have ideas for where our games can go, and I think every idea needs to be listened to.
	We do have a website, however it has not been launched yet.
	This is something that I would like to fix soon.
	<br>
	<br>
	I <i>may</i> consider, in the future, making parts of my dev-tools (and engine too, maybe) open source for the public.
	<br>
	<br>
	I really enjoy working with friends and making games.
	<br>
	Hopefully soon, we'll launch our first official game. :)
