	Part of the class ITP 280 (Video Game Production) at USC, we had to make a mash-up between two games.
	<br>
	I took the class in the Fall of 2010 (my first semester at USC).
	<br>
	Our team (me, Erika Binsley, and Di Wu) chose to mash-up
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus" target="_blank" class="underLineAndCursorLinkOnly">Shadow of the Colossus</a> and
	<a href="http://iro.ragnarokonline.com/" target="_blank" class="underLineAndCursorLinkOnly">Ragnarok Online</a>.
	<br>
	The game was to be an MMO with strong party/raid focus against large cinematic-styled bosses.
	<br>
	<br>
	I made an animated trailer for our game idea. 
	<br>
	This took me about 3 - 5 days to complete (in my spare time). It was fun bringing my PS2 to lab and recording game play to then animate over.
	<br>
	I used Flash, Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and some video capture software.
	<br>
	Erika picked out and added in the music.
	<br>
	<br>
	Here's the trailer:
