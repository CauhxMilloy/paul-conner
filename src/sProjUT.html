	I took a class on usability testing (CTIN 404) at USC in the Spring of 2012.
	<br>
	We, Alex Kubodera (my partner) and I, teamed up with another class (CTIN 464, Intermediate Games) - which makes a game.
	<br>
	We set up, conducted and recorded play tests on the game we were assigned to (which was a game titled Thralled).
	<br>
	At the end, each student had to make a presentation to show some results from the usability tests that every one respectively held.
	<br>
	Play testers featured: Jinson Yu, Brandon Risberg, Nick Covey, Scott Gowin, Sean Stathatos, Anna Fu, Matt Tanaka, and Brehon Humphrey.

	This is my video about the tests that I conducted:
