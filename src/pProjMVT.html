<div style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
	Multi-viewtube was a site that I made mid-2012.
	<br>
	The site took me about 3 days to make - at some point, I'd like to go back to it and freshen it up.
	<br>
	I'm really happy with how this site turned out.
	<br>
	This was the first time I really had used Javascript, and I used this project as a means to teach it to myself.
	<br>
	My knowledge of web-based languages has grown a lot since then, and I can't wait to update the site.
	<br>
	My main motivation to make this site was to watch all the
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ZbN8hGFBw" target="_blank" class="underLineAndCursorLinkOnly">yogscast minecraft hungergames</a>
	clips at the same time.
	<br>
	I couldn't find any other sites that let me do that many videos - nor would they let me synch the vids properly.
	<br>
	So, I made this site.
	<br>
	<br>
	I hope you enjoy it:
