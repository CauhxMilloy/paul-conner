<div style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
	Multi-viewtube was a site that I made mid-2012.
	<br>
	The site took me about 3 days to make. I'm really happy with how the site turned out. This was the first time I really had used Javascript, and I used this project as a means to teach it to myself. I've always prefered compiled languages (like C/C++), but variety is fun.
	<br>
	<br>
	My main motivation to make this site was to watch all the
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ZbN8hGFBw" target="_blank" class="underLineAndCursorLinkOnly">yogscast minecraft hungergames</a>
	clips at the same time.
	<br>
	I couldn't find any other sites that let me do that many videos - nor would they let me synch the vids properly. So, I made this site.
	<br>
	<br>
	I do not have the site up any longer, but here's a sample screenshot:
