	Final Games is the year long capstone class at USC for CS (Games) majors.
	I spent Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 (my last two semesters) working in Final Games.
	I was the Lead Engineer on one of the Final Games teams, Conclave.
	<br>
	<br>
	Conclave is a spell based third-person shooter in a fantasy setting.
	We recognize a hole in the game-genre sphere - where most modern games are team based, Conclave is free-for-all.
	We're trying to fill that void and bring back the fun of FFA - fun that we havn't really seen since back in the day with games like Quake.
	Conclave is a full-over source mod. It's written 100% in C++ using the Source Game Engine - the engine behind Half-Life 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2.
	<br>
	<br>
	As Lead Engineer, I - of course - do some back end programming.
	But, in addition to that, I also work with people to make sure everyone is on the same page.
	I'm always making sure that the engineers that I work with have everything that they need to do their jobs as best as they can.
	I also talk to designers to make sure we have all the necessary spec sheets that we need to implement features fluidly.
	I am in constant hussle to make sure everything is going smoothly. It's really fun to play a supporting role in almost everything.
	Though I know that I'm not directly touching a whole lot, I know that my indirect influence is making a difference.
	<br>
	<br>
	But, I will never take that as a reason to not work directly. I really like role of a lead; it lets me help in whatever way I can.
	One of the goals that I have us strive for, as a team, is that everything is scriptable.
	Many of the features that we've implemented over that last year has taken Source (a mostly hard-code driven engine) and turned it into a (mostly) script based engine.
	If a designer or engineer needs a new value in script (that's never been used before), they can just add it in the script and it's automagically waiting for them to use.
	<br>
	<br>
	The other engineers that I work with are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Zachary Noble
		</li>
		<li>
			Ryan Foote
		</li>
		<li>
			Josh Hickernell
		</li>
		<li>
			Andy Martin
		</li>
		<li>
			Rahul Gollarahalli
		</li>
		<li>
			Erik Frimodig
		</li>
		<li>
			Brandon Risberg
		</li>
	</ul>
	There's 6 desginers, our producer, our proj lead/lead designer, and a fluxuating number of artists.
	<br>
	I make sure that I'm talking to everyone. Perfect communication is my goal.
	<br>
	For version control, we use Subversion. I really like SVN and have become a pro at using it.
	<br>
	I wrote a <a href="#pprojSG" class="underLineAndCursorLinkOnly">guide</a> on proper use of SVN; I put it up in my personal projects section. Check it out if you're interested.
