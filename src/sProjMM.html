	Murder Mansion is a board game that I made along with Matthew Ein, Matthew Tanaka, and Erik Frimodig.
	This was a project for the CTIN 488 (Game Design Workshop) class at USC that we made in Spring 2012.
	The board game focuses on the strategic side of the "killer in the mansion" story architype.
	I'm really proud of the game. It's really fun to play and its fun to trick the others into falsely believing you're not the killer/deducing who the killer is.
	I'd like to, perhaps, in the future make a PC/XBOX version of this game.

	Here's a trailer that we made for the game:
