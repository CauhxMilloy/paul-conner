	I wrote this guide for my
	<a href="#sprojC" class="underLineAndCursorLinkOnly">Conclave</a> team.
	<br>
	After everyone reviewed the guide, we didn't have any major conflicts.
	<br>
	I really like SVN; I think its the best version control system around.
	<br>
	However, I understand it has a ton of burden of knowledge to it.
	<br>
	That is why I made this guide, to help as many people through the burden of knowledge.
	<br>
	Let us all realize the glory of SVN.
	<br>
	More merge for the merge God! Branches for the branch throne!
