	Danger Space is a multiplayer space dog fighting game.
	<br>
	I made the game with Sam Mazer and Josh Hickernell in ITP 380 (Video Game Programming) in the Spring of 2011.
	<br>
	The game was developed in C# using XNA - it could play on Windows or XBOX (if deployed).
	<br>
	The game featured three ships to play as:
	<ul>
		<li>
			The Swordfish (from Cowboy Bebop)
		</li>
		<li>
			The X-Wing (from Star Wars)
		</li>
		<li>
			and a Vespa.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Game features include:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Split-screen (up to 4) multiplayer.
		</li>
		<li>
			Networked multi-player.
		</li>
		<li>
			Hostile AI - with randomized differing strategies.
		</li>
		<li>
			3D Radar
		</li>
		<li>
			Pretty particles.
		</li>
		<li>
			A Space Vespa.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Art was done by: Sam Mazer, Tomas Almera, and Isabella Cheng.
	<br>
	I worked directly on the follow camera, split-screen, networked multiplayer, frustum culling, and the 3D radar.
